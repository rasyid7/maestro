- **Reports in HTML** ([#1750](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/pull/1750) by [Depa Panjie Purnama](https://github.com/depapp))

  To see it, run `maestro test --format HTML <your-flow.yaml>`

  If you prefer to switch your installation of Maestro to use Homebrew:
    1. `rm -rf ~/.maestro`
    2. `brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap && brew install maestro` üéâ

    Script install method is still supported.
